# 🚨 REPOSITORY ARCHIVED

**This repository has been archived.** Docker resources for Cal.com have been moved into the main monorepo at [calcom/cal.com](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com).

## What This Means

- **Docker resources are now maintained in the main Cal.com repository**: All Dockerfile and docker-compose configurations are now part of the [calcom/cal.com](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com) monorepo.
- **Official support**: Our team will begin to officially support the Dockerfile and docker-compose resources in the main repository.
- **Important**: Cal.com will **not** be supporting installations that use these Docker resources. While we provide and maintain the Docker configurations, support for Docker-based installations is community-driven.
